The veterans who are diagnosed with these conditions have a difficult time handling the stress and the memories of the event which impacted their ability to perform day to day functions, interact normally with family and friends, and maintain gainful employment.   The name of this program is CHI – Canines and Heroes for Independence. When teamed with a well-mannered service dog the veteran is able to receive a vitally important reality affirmation when the dog is summoned. Tactile stimulation can be very calming under stressful situations. The dog can be trained to nudge his partner to “snap” the veteran out of a frozen moment caused by anxiety or wake him up while having nightmares, or night terrors by turning on a light. The veteran can give a cue for the dog to stand between himself and other people to feel more comfortable in public places.\n",
