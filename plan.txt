Notes for service dogs scrape

1) 3 divs in a row have font tag w/ this class:
size12 ArialNarrow12

First 2 of those divs are empty. Third one contains name of org (get text).

2) Following div has font tag with this class:
size10 Helvetica10
The DIV ITSELF contains:
align="right"

Contains location (get text).

3) Following div ALSO has font tag with this class:
size10 Helvetica10

Contains URL (get href contents). Text in the A element is inconsistent.

4) Following div ALSO has font tag with this class:
size10 Helvetica10
Getting text from div will be okay, but see SNAG below.
Cannot get text from font tag because multiple font tags are used inside the div.

Contains description (get text).

SNAG: Some orgs have one paragraph, some have multiple, for description. Each paragraph is a div, no p tags, many font tags <font face="">
In between every two grafs is another div, empty.

IDEA: use the 2 blank lines to signal end of descrip?
