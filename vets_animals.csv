Warrior Canine Connection,Maryland,http://warriorcanineconnection.org/,"Warrior Canine Connection TM (WCC) is a therapeutic service dog training program that harnesses the healing power of the human-animal bond. WCC TM teaches service members with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) the skill of training mobility service dogs to be partnered with Veterans with mobility impairments. This worthy mission is specifically designed to reduce the symptoms of PTSD in the warriors who train the dogs--and the great news is, it works! These warrior-trained service dogs are then partnered with veterans to provide them years of loyal companionship as well as an increased sense of wellbeing and independence."
*Warrior Service Dogs,"Asheville, NC",http://warriorservicedogs.org/,"Warrior Service Dogs is a non-profit organization started by three OEF/OIF combat veterans based in Western North Carolina. Our training is led by certified dog trainer and behavior modification specialist Shane Cox, as well as certified dog trainer Chris Stewart. We are currently holding training sessions to any veteran. If you have a dog bring him/her out and we can see what we can do. If you do not own a dog we would love to scout the local shelters to help you find the right dog. Warrior Service Dogs' goal is to work directly with the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers and support our troops in any and every way possible, through the assistance of well trained service dogs. No matter the disability or the specific needs of our disabled veterans, we will go beyond any expectations to provide the assistance they may need by teaming them with a Warrior Service Dog. We will gladly train a veteran’s pet dog to become their service dog or we will be more then happy to select a dog from local shelters and train it for the veterans needs."
